				<p>Warren Edward Buffett (born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is considered by some to be one of the most successful investors in the world, and as of March 2017 is the second wealthiest person in the United States, and the fourth wealthiest in the world, with a total net worth of $73.3 billion.</p>
				<p class="hidden-xs">
				Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970, and his business exploits have had him referred to as the "Wizard", "Oracle" or "Sage" of Omaha by global media outlets. He is noted for his adherence to value investing and for his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.
				</p>
				<p class="hidden-xs hidden-sm hidden-md">Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent[10] of his fortune to philanthropic causes, primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2009, with Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, Warren founded The Giving Pledge, whereby billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.</p>

					<h3>Books About Warren</h3>

						It would be ideal to sit with Warren, have some Burger King Whopper burger with him and pick his brains. But the next best thing would be to read about his investment and management principles. We are blessed to have awesome authors write their analysis of his life, his strategies and his results and compile them into great books.
